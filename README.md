In the age of AI, our most valuable asset is context. But this context is fragmented across countless browser tabs, chat windows, and documents. **ContextNow was built to solve this.**

It's not just another clipboard manager or a static prompt library; it's a dynamic memory core for your entire AI workflow. It allows you to effortlessly save crucial pieces of information, organize them into evolving "context packs," inject them into any AI conversation, even automatically enhance your prompts. The AI instantly understands your world, saving you countless hours of re-explaining and copy-pasting.

### âœ¨ Key Features

#### ðŸª„ **4. Intelligent Prompt (Coming Soon)**

#### ðŸ”’ **5. Privacy-First, Local Storage**
